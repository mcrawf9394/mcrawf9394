Hello! My name is Michael Crawford!
I am trying to learn how to code to start working some freelance jobs and gain experience to eventually get a job!
I am currently learning javascript, html, and css.
I am also working through the odin project currently, and trying to soak up as much information as possible!
Any assistance or suggestions are welcome!
You can reach me through email at mjc9394@gmail.com
